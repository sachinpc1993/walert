W19,What’s the difference between Bachelor of CS and Bachelor of CS (Professional) degrees?,P108,"The Professional version is just introduced, and first intake will be 2023. Students in the regular (3-yr version), if they perform really well in the first two years, they can apply for an internal transfer into the professional version (4-yr version). It is essentially added internship year to the regular program. The full-year internship (40 weeks) is similar to what Software Engineering students do in their third year. However, you may be able to choose a wider range of companies that suits your preferred career path (cyber security, data science, machine learning, etc).",2

W20,What’s the difference between CS and IT programs?,P114,"CS program covers Computer Science core body of knowledge and will provide a solid foundation in the underlying concepts. It strikes a good balance between the theory and the application of these theories to the application of them into real-life scenarios (in application development). The IT program tip more into the applications with more emphasis on hands-on skills in various aspects of ICT (information and communication technology). Our IT degree has more degree of freedom (much more flexible) in customising the program to your taste, say, if you interested in explore in one aspect of IT (mobile app development, or networking, or security, or business analysis), you can choose your majors and minors in such a way, or if you prefer to go across the breadth.",2
