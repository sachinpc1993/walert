W21Q01,S21,"You'll receive credit for only 75% of the courses you take in the first year. However, with an IT degree, you have more flexibility, allowing you to customize your program according to your preferences. For CS students, it's important to focus on programming courses like web-based, mobile application, and game application development. Additionally, you'll need to complete university-level math, specialist math, or math methods courses.",P61

Yes, some low-end jobs were outsourced such as call centres, however, there is a growing IT industry, especially, within startups, innovative IT technologies, such as home automation, Internet of things, machine learning, etc, which are not, and will not be, outsourced and Melbourne is always at the forefront of these developments. Also, IT-support jobs, in small to medium scale companies, will still remain locally. There were 91000 job adverts in the first half of 2021 alone. 530,000 (more than half a million, out of a workforce of 16.5 million) work in IT sector.

W19Q01,P108,"The Professional version is just introduced, and first intake will be 2023. Students in the regular (3-yr version), if they perform really well in the first two years, they can apply for an internal transfer into the professional version (4-yr version). It is essentially added internship year to the regular program. The full-year internship (40 weeks) is similar to what Software Engineering students do in their third year. However, you may be able to choose a wider range of companies that suits your preferred career path (cyber security, data science, machine learning, etc).",P108
