SE students are required to do one-year industry placement and another 24CP project in their final year. Same for all three professional degrees. All other students are required by RMIT rules to do a capstone project in their final year. It involves with doing a project with an industry partner, or in some cases, an in-house project simulating a real industry scenario. In each case, they are assigned a project supervisor who work closely with you and industry partner to get student experience. In addition to these mandatory WIL requirements, every year we have summer projects and other industry events, such as ANZ hackathon, AIIA iAwards competition, and other coding/ security competitions.\nDocument 5: The first two years of these two programs are near-identical. Then, in the third year of the SE degree, students spend a whole year (roughly 40 working weeks) in an industry placement. They work in a software firm engaging in all facets of software development process, from design to deployment. Final year (third in CS and fourth in SE) are slightly different, in that, SE students will do another large in-house project and more SE electives, while CS students will do a slightly smaller project and a few more core courses and electives.\nAnswer: 'Yes, it is possible to get into a CS program without doing Math Methods in Year 12.

In addition to the above, we offer an honours degree option: a one-year Honours degree which is only be started after completing a regular three year CS degree. It is called Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours). This is not available for Year 12 entry students. We used to offer a Deans Scholar degree, however, it is not offered in 2023.\nDocument 2: Not really. What matters the most is how you performed in your degree. Also, the skills outside the main (such as communication, professional skills, etc) will play an important role in finding a job. A weak CS student with minimal communication skills will find it difficult to find a job than an excellent IT student. No matter what degree you do, do really well and you find jobs.\nDocument 3: There is no direct answer. It is easy between some programs, and not as easy between some programs.

However, going up, such as IT to CS, will require certain requirements and assessed on merit.\nDocument 4: The first two years of these two programs are near-identical. Then, in the third year of the SE degree, students spend a whole year (roughly 40 working weeks) in an industry placement.

As a Software Engineering student or a student of any professional degree, you\'re required to complete a year of industry placement and a final year project. All RMIT students must complete a capstone project in their final year, working closely with an industry partner or in a simulated industry scenario, guided by a project supervisor. Plus, every year, we offer summer projects and industry events such as the ANZ hackathon, AIIA iAwards competition, and various coding and security competitions.\nDocument 3: There are numerous Work-Integrated Learning options, some of which are mandatory and others that are optional. As a Software Engineering student or enrolled in any of the professional degrees, you\'re required to take part in a year of industry placement and a 24-credit-point final year project. It\'s a requirement for all students to undertake a capstone project in their final year, involving a collaboration with an industry partner or an in-house project mimicking real industry situations. A project supervisor will be assigned to work with you closely. We also have summer projects and other industry events such as the ANZ hackathon, AIIA iAwards competition, and various coding or security competitions.\nDocument 4: You have a range of Work-Integrated Learning options to choose from, some compulsory and others optional.
