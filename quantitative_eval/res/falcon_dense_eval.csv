All students need to complete a capstone project in their final year, which may be with an industry partner or simulated as a real industry scenario. For these projects, a dedicated supervisor will work closely with you. Additionally, summer projects and industry events, including ANZ hackathon, AIIA iAwards competition, and various coding or security competitions, are also available each year.\nAnswer: ""Yes, language level is required to study CS as it involves a lot of technical terms and concepts.

A weak CS student with minimal communication skills will find it difficult to find a job than an excellent IT student.

It really depends on the specific university or program you are interested in. Some schools may have more specific requirements or focus on certain areas of CS, so it's important to research the programs you are interested in to see what their requirements are.

In addition to the above, we offer an honours degree option: a one-year Honours degree which is only be started after completing a regular three year CS degree. It is called Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours). This is not available for Year 12 entry students. We used to offer a Deans Scholar degree, however, it is not offered in 2023.\nDocument 5: Depending on the program, a wide choice of electives -- in programming, mobile, and web, networking, cybersecurity, software engineering, is available. In addition, In general, each program has a suite of electives you can choose from. However, if you are interested in taking an elective outside the program structure, you can seek approval from the program manager. In the IT program, you can choose your electives to form a specialisation in one of the IT sub-disciplines (programming, security, DEVOPS, etc) or you can choose them broadly.\nAnswer: ""Yes, there are many majors available for CS without a prerequisite.
