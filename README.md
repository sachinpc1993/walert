We built Walert, a conversational agent that answers FAQs about programs of study that are offered in the School of Computing Technologies at RMIT University. This intent-based approach, deployed in Amazon Echo device, was showcased as a demo at RMIT University’s Open Day in August 2023.

Note: This repository contains all utility code for 'Behind The Scenes' of Walert.

You will find in **quantitative_eval** folder all the required codes and files to rerun the experiments in the paper.
